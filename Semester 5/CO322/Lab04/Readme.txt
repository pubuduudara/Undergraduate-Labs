--> Part 1 and Part 2 are in separate folders.
--> Part 1: All the functions are included in trie.h file

            In order to run Part 1, trie.h should include to run.c (already included)
            and run.c file should be compile and execute

            Since, Part 1 support only up-to 500-600 words separate
            dictionary of words included in the test.txt file.
            (Can change the content)

    Part 2: All the functions are included in trie2.h file

            In order to run Part 1, trie2.h should include to run2.c (already included)
            and run2.c file should be compile and execute

            Can insert 70000 words. But there is a suggesting limitation(termination could occur if there are huge suggestions)
